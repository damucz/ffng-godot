## Structure

[ffng](https://github.com/damucz/ffng-godot/tree/main/ffng) is a [Godot 3 module](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/cpp/custom_modules_in_cpp.html). Just place it in the modules folder in the Godot and [compile whole Godot as you are used to](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/index.html).

[ffng-godot](https://github.com/damucz/ffng-godot/tree/main/ffng-godot) is a simple Godot 3 project featuring the module. It just includes the new ffng node.
